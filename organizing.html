        <h1 id='quick'>Quick Start</h1>

        <p>Here's the very brief summary of what to do to get set up & how to keep things running smoothly:</p>

        <div class='well' style='background-color:#FFF2CC'>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Set up a website.</strong> The Mozilla Science Lab has a <a href='https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup'>template</a> you can use to create a website to list events, create a discussion board and host a chat room.</li>

            <li><strong>Write or adopt a Code of Conduct.</strong> Mozilla Study Groups work best when everyone feels welcome. Adopt the <a href='http://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct/'>Mozilla Science Code of Conduct</a>, or write your own, and enforce it to create a space where people feel comfortable asking questions and speaking to the group.</li>

            <li><strong>Communicate.</strong> Every event you throw should be promoted to a current community of at least 200 people, in order to get 10-20 in attendance. Some strategies for this:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Get on departmental newsletters, emails, and welcome packages for new students & members.</li>
              <li>Make sure everyone 'Watches' the GitHub repo that hosts your website - this way, they'll get email notifications of new events.</li>
              <li>Tweet, blog about events and post lesson materials for reuse.</li>
              <li>Always remember to emphasize that <strong>beginners are very welcome!</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>Follow the Event Guide.</strong> The <a href='events.html'>next chapter</a> describes some possible events, including a detailed plan for your first few, to get things rolling.</li>

            <li><strong>Assemble a team of organziers</strong> to split up the workload, and get representation from as many different departments or organizations as possible.</li>

            <li><strong>Highlight your community.</strong> Invite attendees to lead future sessions at every meeting; use your blog to help draw attention to their work and give them a place to show off.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h1 id='communication'>Communication</h1>

        <p>As researchers, we work with code and data nearly every day, and yet rarely receive training and almost never encounter organized opportunities to discuss, present or collaborate on our coding projects. A Mozilla Study Group creates these opportunities for skill sharing and conversation around research coding; one of the organizers' main jobs, is to communicate these opportunities to the community. There are five main tools to consider for communication: a website, a message board, an outreach channel, a blog, and a chat room. Free services exist for all of these; in this section, we present some ideas for getting them set up smoothly, and some thoughts on how to use them effectively.</p>

        <p>A good baseline to shoot for in your communication strategy: every event should be <strong>advertised to at least 200 current community members</strong> who may be available to attend, resulting in 10-20 people actually showing up.</p>

        <h2>Website</h2>

        <p>A Study Group's website is the first point of contact for newcomers to start finding out what's up. A good intro website should give people enough information to have an idea of what's going on, and a clear path to get involved - and not much else. At this stage, people are just testing the waters; keep it simple, and let them decide if they want to jump in further.</p>

        <p>The Mozilla Science Lab has a <a href='https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup'>template website</a> you can use and adapt however you like. Instructions on how to use it are in the README, under <a href='https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup#how-to-set-up-your-own-study-group-website'>How To Set Up Your Own Study Group Website</a>; if anything is confusing or doesn't work, <a href='mailto:sciencelab@mozillafoundation.org'>reach out</a> to the Science Lab and we'll help you out ASAP. You can see an example of this website <a href='http://mozillascience.github.io/studyGroup/'>here</a>; another, independent example of a great website is from the <a href='http://www.noamross.net/davis-r-users-group.html'>Davis R User's Group</a>. Here's a video walking through the website setup procedure:</p>

        <iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bUJTxWXc6XY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>If you use this template, your website will be built on a GitHub repository (don't worry - no command-line git required), will list recent and upcoming events registered as per the <a href='https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup#how-to-launch-a-new-event'>instructions</a>, and will direct participants to the issue tracker in the same repository, which you can use as a message board. Make sure you include the link to your website in every communication you put out, and it will guide new participants to your community. Here's a video walking through the event listing procedure:</p>

        <iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/abglQgEIccw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h2>Message Board</h2>

        <p>A message board is the online heart of your community; it's where people can come to ask questions, request events, volunteer to lead sessions, and have conversations. Conveniently, GitHub provides a free message board with every repository (they call it an 'issue tracker'); if you used the template website above, you'll have already set up your issue tracker. A few tips for effective issue tracker usage:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Advertise it.</strong> Make sure everyone knows where your issue tracker is, and encourage them to use it; a lively message board indicates a strong community to newcomers.</li>
          <li><strong>Tell people to Watch</strong> the repository - this way, they'll get email notifications of new conversations. They can do this by clicking on 'Watch' at the top of the repository: <img src="https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/notifications/watcher_picker.gif"></img></li>
          <li><strong>Include event details</strong> when you list an event, at least: time, date, place, a link to a map to the location, and a list of dependencies for the event (do participants need to have anything installed or prepared beforehand)?</li>
          <li><strong>Close old issues</strong> that are for past events, resolved questions or long-silent conversations; this keeps the clutter down by hiding old threads, and makes the board easier to read.</li>
          <li><strong>Use labels</strong> to indicate what each thread is about - common ones are 'Event', 'Question', 'Request', and 'Conversation'.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Outreach (Beginners Welcome!)</h2>

        <p>In order to find your Study Group's website and message board, you need to get the word out! There are two good channels for this:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Institutional messaging</strong> from your department, lab, or organization in the form of newsletters, departmental emails, and a note in the welcome packages given to new students or employees go a long way to letting everyone in your community know you're there; these channels also lend a little formal nod to your Study Group, which will help it stand out to busy professionals.</li>
          <li><strong>Twitter</strong> is an effective broadcast medium for pushing out links to your website and announcing events; make up a hashtag people can keep their eye on, tweet out every event and new piece of content your Study Group participates in, and if there are any big Twitter users in your community, tweet at them so they can help spread the word.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some groups have had success with traditional mailing lists; others find them too noisy. In practice, your GitHub issue tracker should serve the role of a mailing list, without having to set up and manage anything extra.</p>

        <p>In general, good messaging for outreach is <strong>short and welcoming</strong>; keep announcements short, include a link to your webpage and the Twitter hashtag your group uses, and always emphasize that beginners are welcome and no experience is necessary.</p>

        <h2>Blogging</h2>

        <p>As a Study Group meets over time, lots of discussions happen and new content gets generated. By creating a record of what you've done, not only will newcomers get an idea of what they're going to see at a meetup, but you will generate a collection of resources and lessons learned that will make the job of organizing your Study Group easier and easier. There are two main records to consider keeping:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>A collection of lesson plans</strong> is an invaluable resource. One of the most popular types of events we'll discuss in the <a href='events.html'>next chapter</a> is a <strong>code-along</strong>, where one person leads the group through a hands-on demonstration of a tool or package. After a code-along, get the lesson notes from the leader and put them somewhere they can be used again; in time, you will build up a collection of lessons that can be delivered with a minimum of preparation. If you're using the template website mentioned above, you can put the lesson notes in a folder in the same repository; if you don't want to maintain the lessons yourself, the Mozilla Science Lab is collecting such lessons <a href='https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroupLessons'>here</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>A blog</strong> can be a great way to keep a record of all the things your group has done show off your work and success, and give more in-depth previews of upcoming events. Also, try showcasing work and articles from your community on your blog; this is a great way to draw attention to your participants and make them a part of the community. A great example is the <a href='https://datasciencehobart.wordpress.com/'>Data Science Hobart blog</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id='chat'>Chat</h2>

        <p>A chat room is a great tool for back-channel chatter at events, and for helping everyone keep in touch between meetups; it's a bit less formal than a message board, making it perfect for fun links and casual conversations. If you're using a GitHub repository to host your website, you can set up a free chat room by the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Visit <a href='https://gitter.im'>Gitter</a>; you may have to sign in with your GitHub credentials.</li>
          <li>Click 'create a room' in the bottom left;</li>
          <li>Choose 'Channel' from the options presented;</li>
          <li>Make the room name 'studyGroup', and select the 'public' option.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After creating your chat room, Gitter will take you there; add this URL to your communications so people know it's there, and drop in regularly to see who's chatting.</p>



        <h1 id='community'>Community</h1>

        <p>The fundamental goal of a Mozilla Study Group should be to give the local community of researchers who code a place to come together, interact and support each other. With enough participation, the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect'>network effect</a> of sharing skills and ideas among a community can overcome the shortfalls that many of us have experienced in education and training around writing code. Also, by creating opportunities to learn and work together, we overcome the <a href='http://www.mozillascience.org/bullying-imposter-phenomenon-the-fraught-process-of-learning-to-code-in-the-lab'>isolation and feelings of inadequacy</a> that many students and early career researchers face when struggling with code alone. It's your job as organizer to be proactive about making sure your Study Group is welcoming to people of all sorts of backgrounds and skill levels.</p>

        <p>We discuss the factors that make up learner morale, sense of belonging and community in more depth in the <a href='http://mozillascience.github.io/instructorTraining/compellingInstruction/index.html'>Compelling Instruction</a> chapter of our teaching kit on leading workshops; the ideas presented there translate more or less exactly onto a Study Group community. A couple of ideas to emphasize in this context:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Have a <strong>Code of Conduct</strong> that demands participants treat each other with respect and make a welcoming space for beginners, and emphasize the presence of this Code to everyone who participates in the Study Group. Having a Code of Conduct signals that diversity is taken seriously by your group, and gives clear grounds to eject someone who treats others poorly. The Mozilla Science Lab has a Code they use for their events; feel free to <a href='http://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct/'>adopt theirs</a>, or write your own.</li>

          <li>Run <strong>lots of events for beginners</strong>, particularly when doing demos and code-alongs. These can be both introductory lessons for people who have never used the language in question before, and also more advanced lessons (perhaps on a specific package or tool) that a beginner can still follow along with; in practice, this means encouraging the demo leader to go slow enough for everyone to copy each step, and be explicit enough that no prior knowledge is required. By taking great care to make sure beginners are able to participate, we ensure that our Study Group includes the people who need the most support; by letting the conversation become too esoteric or inaccessible too often, we run the risk of making people feel even more excluded and behind than ever before.</li>

          <li><strong>Showcase your community</strong> by encouraging lots of different people to lead demos and participate in co-working sessions. Emphasize the fact that people don't need to be experts to lead a session; usually, the most interesting thing is to see how someone else uses a tool or package in their own research, since this is usually more authentic and practical than an academic 'expert lecture'. Also, if you have a blog for your site, give people the chance to showcase their code and research projects there.</li>

          <li><strong>Assemble a team of organizers</strong>, so you don't have to do this all yourself! One challenge Study Groups face is longevity; a solo organizer can get too busy, or move on from the host institution. By having a team of people you trust, not only is the work of organizing events spread out, but adding a new organizer to the team isn't such a big ask; rather than taking over the whole thing, the newcomer need only contribute a share of the organizational effort. Also, try to pull in co-organizers from different departments or organizations in your community, in order to be in touch with the needs and interests of many different groups, and give your Study Group representation within each. Remember to <a href='https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/'>add co-organziers as Collaborators</a> on your GitHub repo, so they can help manage events!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Next Chapter</h2>
        <p>In <a href="events.html">Event Ideas</a>, we'll present some ideas for different types of events you can try out, and give you a play-by-play guide to your first few meetups.</p>
