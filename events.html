        <h1 id='events'>Throwing Events</h1>

        <p>In what follows, we discuss some ideas for events that your Mozilla Study Group can throw; but regardless of the type of event, here are a few guidelines that will help things run smoothly:</p>

        <div class='well' style='background-color:#FFF2CC'>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Let the community lead.</strong> At every opportunity, ask the attendees what they'd like to see at a future event - and invite them to lead. The more people have a hand in designing and throwing events, the more diverse, useful and community-driven your Study Group will be.</li>
            <li><strong>Shoot for events weekly to monthly.</strong> Less frequently than this, and people lose track of what you're up to; more than weekly is hard to keep up with.</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate clearly.</strong> This means making sure all event listing and emails include time, place (with link to a map) and a short description of what the event is about.</li>
            <li><strong>Use your Code of Conduct.</strong> Your Code is there to make sure people feel welcome and are included; don't be afraid to emphasize it and enforce it when the need arises.</li>
            <li><strong>Stick to it!</strong> It might take an event or two for people to tell their friends and word to spread; don't be discouraged if only a few people come to your first couple of events. Stick to it, and you'll have a thriving community soon enough.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h1 id='codealong'>Code-Along</h1>
        <h2>A hands-on guided tour of a tool, package or piece of code.</h2>
        <i>Suggested length: 1 hour.</i>

        <p>Code-alongs are perhaps the most popular Study Group activities, where a demo leader plugs their laptop into a projector and shows how they use a particular package, tool or piece of code in their research, while everyone else follows along on their own machines. These are great opportunities to help your community discover new tools and see novel solutions to problems using code. A few tips for a good code-along:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keep it short.</strong> An hour is plenty long enough; more than this, and it becomes too much to absorb all at once.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> That hour will go by really fast for the demo leader - sixty minutes is really only enough time to cover a few introductory ideas. Remember, there's no final exam; if people walk away with a successful first couple of steps on the topic, that's all they need to get started and learn more in future.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep beginners on board.</strong> This means explicitly illustrating every step, and going slow enough for participants to copy down everything you're doing - so that everyone can follow along.</li>
          <li><strong>No slides.</strong> Slides are boring. The presenter should live-code all their examples, while everyone else follows along on their own machines.</li>
          <li><strong>Give people challenge problems.</strong> If you're the presenter, don't talk the whole time - take a couple of breaks to let your students try their new skills on a challenge problem or two. This also gives you the chance to answer questions, and make sure no one gets lost.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep it real.</strong> Try and illustrate how you actually use the tool in your research; this way, everyone will understand not only how to use it, but why it's valuable in real practice.</li>
          <li><strong>Encourage non-experts to lead.</strong> It is absolutely not required to know everything about a package to lead a demo on it. Always invite participants to lead a future session, and remind them that it's more interesting and more authentic to see how <strong>they</strong> use the tool in question, than to see a more esoteric perspective.</li>
          <li><strong>Collect the lesson plans.</strong> Every time someone teaches a lesson, ask them if their lesson notes or plans can be posted somewhere they can be reused; the demo leader could put them on GitHub themselves, or you could add them to your Study Group's repository, or the Mozilla Science Lab will host and maintain them for you in <a href='https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroupLessons'>their collection</a> of Study Group lessons. In time, you will build up a great library of lessons that can be delivered again as new participants arrive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id='coworking'>Coworking Session</h1>
        <h2>An open session to work on projects and ask each other questions.</h2>
        <i>Suggested length: 2 hours.</i>

        <p>Co-working sessions are a great way to get stuff done and discover new coding techniques. Get your Study Group together for a couple of hours to all sit down and work on their latest coding projects - and encourage everyone to ask each other questions when they get stuck, show off their work and talk to each other about what they're doing. To have a great co-working session, try these tips:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Welcome beginners.</strong> Make sure everyone knows new coders are very welcome, and that it's okay to ask any question you like. Also, make sure the more experienced coders in the group know how to make newcomers feel welcome; treating anything like it's trivial is offputting for people just starting out. <strong>There is no such thing as a 'stupid question' in a Study Group.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Do lightning intros.</strong> At the start of the session, go around the room and have everyone call out tweet-length descriptions of what sort of tools and language they're working in that day - and encourage people using similar tools to chat and work together.</li>
          <li><strong>Have a demo party.</strong> At the end of the session, give people a chance to show off what they're working on to the group - these should be really quick demos, meant to give people just a flavor of what people are doing - and start conversations afterwards.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A variant on the coworking session is the <strong>strategy circle</strong> - invite people to describe a problem they're having, and then open the floor for suggestions on what kind of packages, tools or strategies they could try out to solve their problem. After everyone has had a turn to describe their problem and get some suggestions, open the time up to experiment with those new ideas and get help in open conversations with the group.</p>

        <h1 id='hackyhour'>Hacky Hour</h1>
        <h2>A pub night or cafe meeting for researchers who code.</h2>
        <i>Suggested length: flexible.</i>

        <p>A Hacky Hour is a great, informal way to open things up and encourage community members to meet one another, discuss new ideas, and build the social ties that help strengthen any community. They're also some of the easiest events to organize, since all that's required is an open cafe or pub! A few ideas on making a great Hacky Hour:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Encourage lots of connections.</strong> Any time someone wants to meet to chat about a code project, needs help with a bug, or wants to find out more about what's happening in your community, invite them to Hacky Hour, so they can meet the community and find out first hand. Keep an eye out for people who might have some projects or interests in common, and help make connections.</li>
          <li><strong>Choose the right venue.</strong> A pub or cafe at or near your institution, a little before the busy hours is best (3 or 4 PM Friday). This makes it convenient for everyone to get there and get a seat, and when it's a bit quieter, it's easier for people to have conversations and maybe even hack on a bug or two! When the weather is good, patios are great for this.</li>
          <li><strong>Make it obvious.</strong> Make sure it's easy for newcomers to identify who the Hacky Hour group is at the venue; funny hats can go a long way.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id='lightning'>Coding Lightning Demos</h1>
        <h2>An open house of short tool demos.</h2>
        <i>Suggested length: 1.5 hours.</i>

        <p>A lightning demo is a five-minute demo of a tool or piece of code, meant to make a quick introduction to an audience so they can decide if they're interested in learning more. Get a whole bunch of these together, and you have a Lightning Demo Party! Try these tips for your first round of lightning demos:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Aim for 8-10 demos.</strong> This is enough for there to be some substantial variety at the party, but small enough that it won't take hours for people to check out all the demos.</li>
          <li><strong>5 minutes max.</strong> Ask presenters to keep the demos short; there's plenty to see, and if there's lots of interest in one area, invite the presenter to lead a code-along at a future meetup.</li>
          <li><strong>Include some research context.</strong> Getting the presenters to add a quick comment on how they use their demo in their research will help motivate the tools, and communicate to everyone what their research applications are.</li>
          <li><strong>It's a party!</strong> Set your presenters up in a big horseshoe pattern so people can circulate, and consider serving snacks or drinks if feasible. Setting the scene this way will help encourage people to talk amongst themselves and brainstorm about how they're going to use all these cool new ideas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id='first'>First Steps</h1>

        <p>So far, we've discussed things to think about while setting up your Mozilla Study Group, and some possible event ideas. As we said in the intro, we encourage you to play it by ear, make your own events up, and let us know how it goes! In the following exercise, we walk your through a step-by-step guide to your first four events; give it a try, remix liberally, and your Study Group will be off to a great start.</p>
