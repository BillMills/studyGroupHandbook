        <h1 id='events'>Managing Your Group</h1>

        <p>In what follows, we discuss how to plan and run your Study Group, and describe some possible event types. A few key points to begin with:</p>

        <div class='well' style='background-color:#FFF2CC'>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Let the community lead.</strong> At every opportunity, ask the attendees what they'd like to see at a future event - and invite them to lead. The more people have a hand in designing and throwing events, the more diverse, useful and community-driven your Study Group will be.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan a few months at a time.</strong> Choose a natural rhythm for your group - semesters, terms, or quarters - and try to sketch out a rough plan at the beginning of the period by asking for input from your community, and spreading ideas out.</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate clearly.</strong> This means making sure all event listing and emails include time, place (with link to a map) and a short description of what the event is about, and reminding people a couple of times to come on out.</li>
            <li><strong>Use your Code of Conduct.</strong> Your Code is there to make sure people feel welcome and are included; don't be afraid to emphasize it and enforce it when the need arises.</li>
            <li><strong>Stick to it!</strong> It might take an event or two for people to tell their friends and word to spread; don't be discouraged if only a few people come to your first couple of events. Stick to it, and you'll have a thriving community soon enough.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h1 id='planning'>Planning Events</h1>

        <p>Now that you have a team assembled and a few mailing lists in your community to help spread the word, it's time to start planning and throwing events! Here are a few ideas to keep things running as smoothly as possible.</p>

        <h2>Pace Yourself</h2>

        <div class='well' style='background-color:#FFF2CC'>
          <ul>
            <li>Choose a natural rhythm for your community - terms, semesters, or quarters.</li>
            <li>Do a big advertising push at the beginning of each period, letting people know about Study Group, and asking them what sessions they'd like to see or lead.</li>
            <li>Take the most popular suggestions from your advertising push, and spread them out evenly over the term, one every two weeks.</li>
            <li>In the free weeks, book events like <a href="#coworking">coworking sessions</a>, or other ideas that come up through the term.</li>
            <li>Throw in a <a href="#hackyhour">hacky hour</a> once a month.</li>
            <li>End the period with a big get together for the whole community, to thank them for participating and ask them what they'd like to do next term. Also take this opportunity to discuss with the organizing team what worked this term, and what needs improvement.</li>
          </ul>

        </div>

        <p>Many Study Groups enjoy a ton of excitement and energy when they first get going - events happen every week, attendance is high, and lots of people step up to lead sessions. But, after burning hot and bright for a few months, it can get hard to find a steady stream of content to keep momentum going.</p>

        <p>In order to avoid this, it's important to <strong>plan around the right cadence</strong> for your group; for most institutions, this will be terms, semesters, or quarters - whatever the natural division of time is in your community that splits the year up into three or four parts. At the beginning of terms, people's schedules change - some people will become unavailable, and others will find themselves newly able to attend, which makes this the perfect time to do a big push to advertise your group as widely and loudly as possible.</p>

        <p>As you advertise at the beginning of each term, ask people to suggest topics for lessons; ask them what they're working on, what they'd be interested in leading a session on, and what they'd like to learn about.</p>

        <p>Once responses come in, take the most popular ones and spread them out throughout the term, ideally one every two weeks; that way, both you and your community will have a clear calendar of what to look forward to for the next few months, and you'll save yourself the stress of constantly worrying about what to do next week.</p>

        <p>On the off weeks, add in events like <a href="#coworking">coworking sessions</a>, or throw in new lessons or event ideas as they come up, and once a month do a <a href="#hackyhour">hacky hour</a> to help new people come meet the community.</p> 

        <p> Finally, at the end of the term, take the opportunity to get everyone together to thank them for participating, and ask them what they'd like to see in future. Also, get together in private with the organizing team to discuss how the term went; what events were the most popular? What didn't go as planned? How can you reach an even wider audience next term? At this point, huge congratulations are in order - you delivered a whole term of learning, building and community bonding! Jot down some lessons learned, and next term will be even better. </p>

        <h2>Communicating Events</h2>

        <p>Nobody will come to your events if you don't let people know about them! Follow these steps to effectively communicate about each individual event.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>As early as possible</strong> and at least one week in advance, <a href="https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup#how-to-launch-a-new-event">list your event on your website</a>. Detailed instructions are in the README.md in your repo - basically, make an issue that includes the time, date, place (with a map), topic, and preparation instructions, and add a listing on your website.</li>
          <li><strong>At the start of the week</strong>, send a reminder email to all the mailing lists you have access to, pointing out the events happening that week (remember to include links to the issues describing the events, as well as a link to your Code of Conduct, and tell people to bring their friends!).</li>
          <li><strong>The morning of the event</strong>, comment on the issue describing the event - even a simple 'Looking forward to this today!' is enough, since that will send a notification to everyone watching your repo.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Also, don't forget to ask people to watch your github repo - that way, they'll get updates about everything your Study Group is doing.</p>

        <h1>Event Ideas</h1>

        <p>There are a ton of different types of events you can do in your Study Group. The most popular tend to be <a href="#codealong">code-alongs</a>, but don't be shy to add some variety with other, more open ended events, like the ones below - or come up with something completely new and different! The only rule is to try and include as many people as possible.</p>

        <h2 id='codealong'>Code-Along</h2>
        <h3>A hands-on guided tour of a tool, package or piece of code.</h3>
        <i>Suggested length: 1 hour.</i>

        <p>Code-alongs are perhaps the most popular Study Group activities, where a demo leader plugs their laptop into a projector and shows how they use a particular package, tool or piece of code in their research, while everyone else follows along on their own machines. These are great opportunities to help your community discover new tools and see novel solutions to problems using code. A few tips for a good code-along:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keep it short.</strong> An hour is plenty long enough; more than this, and it becomes too much to absorb all at once.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> That hour will go by really fast for the demo leader - sixty minutes is really only enough time to cover a few introductory ideas. Remember, there's no final exam; if people walk away with a successful first couple of steps on the topic, that's all they need to get started and learn more in future.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep beginners on board.</strong> This means explicitly illustrating every step, and going slow enough for participants to copy down everything you're doing - so that everyone can follow along.</li>
          <li><strong>No slides.</strong> Slides are boring. The presenter should live-code all their examples, while everyone else follows along on their own machines.</li>
          <li><strong>Give people challenge problems.</strong> If you're the presenter, don't talk the whole time - take a couple of breaks to let your students try their new skills on a challenge problem or two. This also gives you the chance to answer questions, and make sure no one gets lost.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep it real.</strong> Try and illustrate how you actually use the tool in your research; this way, everyone will understand not only how to use it, but why it's valuable in real practice.</li>
          <li><strong>Encourage non-experts to lead.</strong> It is absolutely not required to know everything about a package to lead a demo on it. Always invite participants to lead a future session, and remind them that it's more interesting and more authentic to see how <strong>they</strong> use the tool in question, than to see a more esoteric perspective.</li>
          <li><strong>Collect the lesson plans.</strong> Every time someone teaches a lesson, ask them if their lesson notes or plans can be posted somewhere they can be reused; the demo leader could put them on GitHub themselves, or you could add them to your Study Group's repository, or the Mozilla Science Lab will host and maintain them for you in <a href='https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroupLessons'>their collection</a> of Study Group lessons. In time, you will build up a great library of lessons that can be delivered again as new participants arrive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id='coworking'>Coworking Session</h2>
        <h3>An open session to work on projects and ask each other questions.</h3>
        <i>Suggested length: 2 hours.</i>

        <p>Co-working sessions are a great way to get stuff done and discover new coding techniques. Get your Study Group together for a couple of hours to all sit down and work on their latest coding projects - and encourage everyone to ask each other questions when they get stuck, show off their work and talk to each other about what they're doing. To have a great co-working session, try these tips:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Welcome beginners.</strong> Make sure everyone knows new coders are very welcome, and that it's okay to ask any question you like. Also, make sure the more experienced coders in the group know how to make newcomers feel welcome; treating anything like it's trivial is offputting for people just starting out. <strong>There is no such thing as a 'stupid question' in a Study Group.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Do lightning intros.</strong> At the start of the session, go around the room and have everyone call out tweet-length descriptions of what sort of tools and language they're working in that day - and encourage people using similar tools to chat and work together.</li>
          <li><strong>Have a demo party.</strong> At the end of the session, give people a chance to show off what they're working on to the group - these should be really quick demos, meant to give people just a flavor of what people are doing - and start conversations afterwards.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A variant on the coworking session is the <strong>strategy circle</strong> - invite people to describe a problem they're having, and then open the floor for suggestions on what kind of packages, tools or strategies they could try out to solve their problem. After everyone has had a turn to describe their problem and get some suggestions, open the time up to experiment with those new ideas and get help in open conversations with the group.</p>

        <h2 id='hackyhour'>Hacky Hour</h2>
        <h3>A pub night or cafe meeting for researchers who code.</h3>
        <i>Suggested length: flexible.</i>

        <p>A Hacky Hour is a great, informal way to open things up and encourage community members to meet one another, discuss new ideas, and build the social ties that help strengthen any community. They're also some of the easiest events to organize, since all that's required is an open cafe or pub! A few ideas on making a great Hacky Hour:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Encourage lots of connections.</strong> Any time someone wants to meet to chat about a code project, needs help with a bug, or wants to find out more about what's happening in your community, invite them to Hacky Hour, so they can meet the community and find out first hand. Keep an eye out for people who might have some projects or interests in common, and help make connections.</li>
          <li><strong>Choose the right venue.</strong> A pub or cafe at or near your institution, a little before the busy hours is best (3 or 4 PM Friday). This makes it convenient for everyone to get there and get a seat, and when it's a bit quieter, it's easier for people to have conversations and maybe even hack on a bug or two! When the weather is good, patios are great for this.</li>
          <li><strong>Make it obvious.</strong> Make sure it's easy for newcomers to identify who the Hacky Hour group is at the venue; funny hats can go a long way.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id='lightning'>Coding Lightning Demos</h2>
        <h3>An open house of short tool demos.</h3>
        <i>Suggested length: 1.5 hours.</i>

        <p>A lightning demo is a five-minute demo of a tool or piece of code, meant to make a quick introduction to an audience so they can decide if they're interested in learning more. Get a whole bunch of these together, and you have a Lightning Demo Party! Try these tips for your first round of lightning demos:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Aim for 8-10 demos.</strong> This is enough for there to be some substantial variety at the party, but small enough that it won't take hours for people to check out all the demos.</li>
          <li><strong>5 minutes max.</strong> Ask presenters to keep the demos short; there's plenty to see, and if there's lots of interest in one area, invite the presenter to lead a code-along at a future meetup.</li>
          <li><strong>Include some research context.</strong> Getting the presenters to add a quick comment on how they use their demo in their research will help motivate the tools, and communicate to everyone what their research applications are.</li>
          <li><strong>It's a party!</strong> Set your presenters up in a big horseshoe pattern so people can circulate, and consider serving snacks or drinks if feasible. Setting the scene this way will help encourage people to talk amongst themselves and brainstorm about how they're going to use all these cool new ideas.</li>
        </ul>
