        <h1 id='introduction'>Introduction</h1>

        <p>Writing and working with code is becoming a necessary part of daily life for scientists and researchers in almost every field - and yet, the skills to do so are still not included in most formal curricula, few places exist to support and encourage the discussion of scientific code and coding, and opportunities to collaborate on this crucial element of research are rare and hard to find. As a result, students and new researchers struggle to build the skills they need to pursue the science they aspire to, leading to an <a href='http://www.mozillascience.org/bullying-imposter-phenomenon-the-fraught-process-of-learning-to-code-in-the-lab'>epidemic of imposter syndrome</a> in the lab, and risking the waste of a tremendous amount of time and money as we fail to identify places to share and reuse research code, and instead reinvent the wheel, over and over.</p>

        <p>It's possible to address these problems effectively today, by creating a <strong>Mozilla Study Group</strong>. Mozilla Study Groups are regular meetups of scientists and researchers that seek to help everyone involved improve their coding skills, learn about tools and ideas they otherwise might not have discovered, and work together to overcome problems and share solution - think of them like a journal club for code. We'd like to achieve three main goals in a Study Group:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skill Sharing.</strong> Working on your own, you and all the members of your lab, department or institution have learned things about coding - a good Mozilla Study Group brings all that learning together in a forum where we can share those skills with each other, and help each other learn.</li>
          <li><strong>Idea Discovery.</strong> There is an incredibly rich world of open-source code and projects available on the web to support science and research - and yet, we've never found a better mechanism than word of mouth to help people find out what tools will really supercharge their research. A Mozilla Study Group helps bring the experiences of many people together, so everyone can more easily find out about the tools, code and projects that already exist out there that might be just what they need.</li>
          <li><strong>Community Support.</strong> Because so little formal attention has been paid to coding in the lab, the process of learning to code has at times proven isolating, stressful and immensely time consuming for many early career researchers. A Mozilla Study Group should give people a place where they can ask questions, get help and understand that they are neither alone nor behind in their efforts to get comfortable with coding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id='hack'>Hack This Book</h1>

        <p>This handbook serves two purposes. In <a href="organizing.html">Organizing a Mozilla Study Group</a>, we'll discuss how to easily set up things like website and communication channels for your Study Group, and strategies for organizing great events without it becoming a full time job. After that, in <a href="events.html">Event Ideas</a> and <a href="lessons.html">Lesson Ideas</a>, we'll describe some example events that have been successful in the past, and point you to curriculum and other resources you can reuse for your own purposes.</p>

        <p>These ideas are based on <a href='http://forum.mozillascience.org/t/research-coding-q-a-march-24-2015-3-pm-pdt/'>stories</a> from other Study Groups around the world - but feel free to change anything you like! Different strategies will work for different groups, so change things up and <a href='mailto:sciencelab@mozillafoundation.org'>let us know</a> what happens; the only hard rule is to create a place that <a href='http://mozillascience.github.io/instructorTraining/compellingInstruction/index.html'>respects & welcomes</a> everybody.</p>

        <h1 id='map'>Study Groups & Meetups Worldwide</h1>
        <p>There are already open science and skill-sharing meetups starting around the world, both with Mozilla and on their own; orange pins on the map are groups that got started with us, and blue pins are independent groups you can join; click on a pin to find a link describing how to get involved in each group. When you start a Mozilla Study Group, <a href='mailto:sciencelab@mozillafoundation.org'>let us know</a>, and we'll add you to the map!</p>

        <h2>Next Chapter</h2>
        <p>In <a href="organizing.html">Organizing a Mozilla Study Group</a>, we'll learn how to set up a simple website and communication channels for our Study Group, so we can start listing events and reaching out to our community, and discuss some day-to-day event planning and management.</p>
