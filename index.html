        <h1 id='introduction'>Introduction</h1>

        <p>The open science movement is presenting a growing menu of opportunities to reimagine the way we do research. Evidence continues to mount that the open publication of <a href='https://peerj.com/articles/175/'>data</a> and <a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.5418'>papers</a> benefits the researchers who publish them and the pace of discovery as a whole; and the creation, modification and reuse of software is becoming <a href='https://zenodo.org/record/14809#.VZMzfqbe-nc'>ubiquitous</a> across all fields of research and a fundamental lab skill. And yet, these ideas haven't made their way into formal curriculum, and few places exist to support and encourage their exploration. Where does a researcher go to learn these skills and start these conversations?</p>

        <p>You can help us make those opportunities today, by creating a <strong>Mozilla Study Group</strong>. Mozilla Study Groups are regular meetups of scientists and researchers that seek to help everyone involved improve their coding skills, learn about open practice, and work together to make this new research paradigm work for them - think of them like a journal club for open research. We'd like to achieve three main goals in a Study Group:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skill Sharing.</strong> Working on your own, you and all the members of your lab, department or institution have learned many useful open science skills, from data management to coding to publishing - a good Mozilla Study Group brings all that learning together in a forum where we can share those skills with each other, and help each other learn.</li>
          <li><strong>Idea Discovery.</strong> There is an incredibly rich world of tools, open-source code, and data available on the web to support science and research - and yet, we've never found a better mechanism than word of mouth to help researchers find out what opportunities are waiting for them on the web. A Mozilla Study Group helps bring the experiences of many people together, so everyone can more easily find out what's out there that might be just what they need.</li>
          <li><strong>Community Support.</strong> Because so many disciplines are still figuring out how to make open practices work for them, and so little formal attention has been paid to coding in the lab, the process of engaging in open science can be confusing and even isolating for many early career researchers. A Mozilla Study Group should give people a place where they can ask questions, get help and understand that they are neither alone nor behind in their efforts to get comfortable with all the skills involved in doing science today.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id='hack'>Hack This Book</h1>

        <p>This handbook serves two purposes. In <a href="setting-up.html">Setting Up a Mozilla Study Group</a>, we'll discuss how to easily set up things like website and communication channels for your Study Group, and strategies for organizing great events without it becoming a full time job. After that, in <a href="running.html">Running a Mozilla Study Group</a> and <a href="lessons.html">Lesson Ideas</a>, we'll describe some example events that have been successful in the past, and point you to curriculum and other resources you can reuse for your own purposes.</p>

        <p>These ideas are based on <a href='http://forum.mozillascience.org/t/research-coding-q-a-march-24-2015-3-pm-pdt/'>stories</a> from other Study Groups around the world - but feel free to change anything you like! Different strategies will work for different groups, so change things up and <a href='mailto:sciencelab@mozillafoundation.org'>let us know</a> what happens; the only hard rule is to create a place that <a href='http://mozillascience.github.io/instructorTraining/compellingInstruction/index.html'>respects & welcomes</a> everybody.</p>

        <h1 id='map'>Study Groups Worldwide</h1>
        <p>Study Groups are starting around the world! Click on a pin to find a link describing how to get involved in each group. When you start a Mozilla Study Group, <a href='mailto:sciencelab@mozillafoundation.org'>let us know</a>, and we'll add you to the map!</p>

        <h2>Next Chapter</h2>
        <p>In <a href="setting-up.html">Organizing a Mozilla Study Group</a>, we'll learn how to set up a simple website and communication channels for our Study Group, so we can start listing events and reaching out to our community, and discuss some day-to-day event planning and management.</p>
